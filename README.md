Most complex and innovative Dashboard
Designed for those who like bold elements and beautiful websites. Made of hundred of elements, designed blocks and fully coded pages, Soft UI Dashboard is ready to help you create stunning websites and webapps.

We created many examples for pages like Sign In, Profile and so on. Just choose between a Basic Design, an illustration or a cover and you are good to go!

**Fully Coded Elements**

Soft UI Dashboard is built with over 70 frontend individual elements, like buttons, inputs, navbars, navtabs, cards or alerts, giving you the freedom of choosing and combining. All components can take variations in colour, that you can easily modify using SASS files and classes.

**Documentation built by Developers**

Each element is well presented in a very complex documentation.
